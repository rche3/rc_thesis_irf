A very brief summary for how to use this repository (rogerchen6879@gmail.com for more details):

The "MdlAvg_RZApp" folder produces the key results for Section 3 and 5.

The "IRF_ThousDGP_Sim" folder produces the large-scale simulation results in Section 4 (note that to run this code, it will take several days on a standard device).
